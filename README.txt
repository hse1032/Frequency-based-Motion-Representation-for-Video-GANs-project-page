Supplementary material commentary

Our supplementary material contains one html file and several mp4 files.
All videos can be viewed by html file, so we recommend to open "index.html" file to visualize videos.

Videos contains the generation results of the followings:
1. removing scenario on toy dataset
2. randomly sampled videos
3. video diversity (decomposition of motion and content)
4. video interpolation
5. video extrapolation
6. frequency-based motion manipulation
7. removing manipulation
8. altering manipulation

If you want to browse videos by mp4 file, you can use below directory tree to find the specific generation result.

resources/
├─ diversity/
├─ extrapolation/
├─ interpolation/
├─ manipulation/
│  ├─ altering/
│  ├─ removing/
│  ├─ BAIR/
│  ├─ FF/
│  ├─ vox/

Each directory contains below results.
resources/							- random sampled videos
resources/diversity/				- videos generated by different motion and content code
resources/extrapolation/			- extrapolation results
resources/interpolation/			- interpolation results
resources/manipulation/altering/	- altering manipulation results
resources/manipulation/removing/	- removing manipulation results
resources/manipulation/BAIR/		- manipulation results in BAIR-robot dataset
resources/manipulation/FF/			- manipulation results in FaceForensics dataset
resources/manipulation/vox/			- manipulation results in VoxCeleb2-mini dataset
